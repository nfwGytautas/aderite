General:
	Engine callbacks (entity deleted, scene deleted, scene unloaded, etc.)
	Event system?
	Animations
	Fix dependencies folder and CMake
	Memory manager
	BGFX leaks
	Profiling
	Compiler switch to disable some setters in runtime
	Handle storage?

Licensing:
	FMOD splash screen
	PhysX splash screen
	bgfx splash screen

Runtime:
	Serialization:
		Name resolve
	Asset manager:
		Loaded asset leeway, so not to instantly unload
	Rendering:
		BGFX multithread encoder
		Change render settings
	Audio:
		3D audio
		Clear finished one shot instances
	Physics:
		Move kinematic to base actor
		Multithreading
		Physics material asset
		Disable/enable actors at runtime
		Disable/enable colliders at runtime
		Broad-Phase callbacks
		Collision layers
	Scripting:
		Instance caching
		Dont kill entire editor on script run error
		Load on project open
	Code:
		Component interface for getData
		DLLs instead of static libs
		Middleware sections
		Utility operators for types
		Check memory leaks
		Move logger to engine system
		Remove pointers where not needed
		default/delete modifiers

Editor:
	Asset browser:
		Verify that the drag drop imported file can actually be used for the specified type
	VFS:
		Clean assets that are not tracked
		Add to root VFS files that don't have an actual file
	Scripting:
		Don't add the same event twice
		Remove event mapping
	Node editor:
		Display name for pins and nodes
	Must have:
		Reset game state on game mode switch
		Block edit on when in game mode
		3D gizmo
		Create build command, to build entire game
		Comment Graph code
		Rename graph pins without disconnecting them
		Add sampler names to material type
	Icons:
		Handmade icons
		Actual mesh instead of an icon in asset browser (cache result)
		Actual materials instead of an icon in asset browser (cache result)
	Panels/Components:
		Include BGFX stats to ImGui
		Loading bar
		Internal system UI windows (loaded assets, asset manager, etc.)
		Log window
	Utility:
		Provide default utility scripts
		Speed up load time on project load
		Default pipeline for scenes
		Load last opened project
		Drag drop files from system
		Link FMOD studio Build dir with editor
		Generate .csproj file for easier coding
		Physics raycast debug visuals
		Clean generate shader code after compilation of graph
	Code:
		Rework pin type to be enum
		List item select (merge SelectScriptModal, SelectClipModal)
		Split inspector to not be so monolithic
		Modal base class
	UI improvements:
		Remove tab bar button
		Move radio buttons for entities to Base tab
		Enable depth for wireframe
		Delete renaming content asset browser
		Open graph when selecting apropriate asset
		Show if have a valid data source for texture and mesh
		Directory renaming in tree node
		Double clicking drag drop target show in asset browser
		Save after renaming
	Bugs:
		On material type property delete link gets disconnected
		Recovery from failure
		Block from naming properties the same name
		Node editor middle mouse also moves scene view
		Window resize for viewport
		Drag drop files to folders
		Crash on bad graph compile
		Crash when selected entity is destroyed
	Maybe:
		Don't compile when loading project
		Dont load scripts if they are out of date
		Tooltips
