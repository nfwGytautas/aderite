# aderite
A game engine that started as a C++ learning exercise turned into a genuine attempt to create a game engine. 
Before aderite I created various other frameworks/engines and found that dealing with graphics API is something I am not that interested in.
Therefor I used bgfx here. I managed to get the engine to a state where it started resembling something that might have a use case.
As I was nearing the end of my studies I decided to use this engine as my bachelors project. The final state can be found in the bachelor branch.

As far as development is concerned I am no longer devloping this. Altho I tried to comeback a few times I no longer have the drive to write a game engine atleast alone ;).
